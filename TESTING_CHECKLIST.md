# Post-Migration Testing Checklist

## ✅ Database Verification (Run in Supabase SQL Editor)

### 1. Run the Verification Query

Execute `POST_MIGRATION_VERIFICATION.sql` and verify:

- ✅ All 8 new columns exist in deals table
- ✅ Commission tables (commission_rates, commissions) exist
- ✅ RLS is enabled on commission tables
- ✅ Commission triggers exist on deals table
- ✅ Onboarding fields exist in accounts table

### 2. Verify Data Sync

Check that existing deals have data in the new columns:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    title,
    owner_user_id,
    user_id,           -- Should match owner_user_id
    amount,
    value,             -- Should match amount
    stage
FROM deals
LIMIT 5;
```

## 🧪 Application Testing

### Test 1: Deals Page

1. Go to https://crm.rankedceo.com/deals
2. ✅ Page loads without errors
3. ✅ See list of existing deals
4. ✅ Statistics show correctly (total value, won deals, etc.)

### Test 2: Create New Deal

1. Click "New Deal" button
2. Fill in the form:
   - Title: "Test Deal #1"
   - Value: $15,000
   - Stage: "Lead"
   - Win Probability: 50%
   - Expected Close Date: [select a date]
3. Click Save
4. ✅ Deal appears in the list
5. ✅ All fields display correctly

### Test 3: Edit Existing Deal

1. Click on any existing deal
2. Change the stage to "Qualified"
3. Click Save
4. ✅ Changes save successfully
5. ✅ Deal updates in the list

### Test 4: Commission Auto-Creation

1. Edit a deal (or create a new one)
2. Change stage to "Won"
3. Click Save
4. Go to https://crm.rankedceo.com/commissions
5. ✅ New commission record appears
   - Deal value should be set
   - Amount might be $0.00 if no commission rate is set (this is expected)

### Test 5: Set Up Commission Rate

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- First, get your user_id and account_id
SELECT id as user_id, account_id
FROM users
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Replace with your actual IDs
INSERT INTO commission_rates (account_id, user_id, rate, is_active)
VALUES (
    'your-account-id',   -- Replace with actual account_id
    'your-user-id',      -- Replace with actual user_id
    10.00,               -- 10% commission rate
    true
);
```

Then:

1. Create another deal or use an existing one
2. Change stage to "Won" (if not already)
3. Go to /commissions
4. ✅ Commission amount is calculated correctly (deal_value * rate / 100)

### Test 6: Update Commission Rate

1. Update a deal's value (e.g., from $15,000 to $20,000)
2. Make sure stage is "Won"
3. Go to /commissions
4. ✅ Commission amount updates automatically

### Test 7: Onboarding Wizard

5. Complete Step 3: Preferences
6. Complete Step 4: Team Setup
7. Complete Step 5: Finish
8. ✅ Redirects to dashboard
9. ✅ Dashboard shows your name and data

### Test 8: Onboarding Functions

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify onboarding was updated:

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    onboarding_completed,
    onboarding_step,
    onboarding_skipped,
    onboarding_completed_at
FROM accounts
WHERE id = 'your-account-id';
```

2. Go to /onboarding
3. Click "Skip for now"
4. ✅ Redirects to dashboard
5. ✅ onboarding_skipped = true in database

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Deals Page Shows Errors

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check Supabase logs for database errors
3. Verify RLS policies are working:

```sql
SELECT * FROM deals LIMIT 1;
-- Should only show deals for your account
```

### If Commissions Don't Auto-Create

1. Verify trigger exists:

```sql
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_table = 'deals';
```

2. Check if commission was created:

```sql
SELECT * FROM commissions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

3. Check trigger function logs in Supabase logs

### If Commission Amount is $0

This is expected if no commission rate is set. Set up a commission rate:

```sql
INSERT INTO commission_rates (account_id, user_id, rate, is_active)
VALUES ('your-account-id', 'your-user-id', 10.00, true);
```

### If Onboarding Fails

1. Check if functions exist:

```sql
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name IN ('complete_onboarding', 'update_onboarding_step');
```

2. Check accounts table for onboarding fields:

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'accounts' AND column_name LIKE '%onboarding%';
```
