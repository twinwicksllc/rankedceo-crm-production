{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "That's an excellent idea! Starting a fresh repository will solve the git history issues we're facing with the large files. Let me create a new repository and push our clean code there.\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\n## Starting Fresh with a New Repository - Great Idea! 🎯\n\nYou're absolutely right - starting a new repository is the cleanest solution. This will:\n- ✅ Eliminate all git history issues with large files\n- ✅ Give us a clean slate with only the code we've built\n- ✅ Make deployment to Vercel straightforward\n- ✅ Avoid any legacy issues from the old repository\n\n### Options for the New Repository:\n\n**Option 1: Create a brand new repository**\n- I can create a new repository called something like `rankedceo-crm-v2` or `rankedceo-crm-production`\n- Push all our clean code (Phases 1-6) to it\n- Set it up for immediate Vercel deployment\n\n**Option 2: Use the existing repository but with a fresh start**\n- Create a new orphan branch (no history)\n- Push our clean code to it\n- This keeps the same repository name\n\n### My Recommendation:\nI recommend **Option 1** - creating a completely new repository. This gives us:\n- A clean professional start\n- No confusion with old branches\n- Clear separation from any previous issues\n- Fresh deployment setup\n\n### What I'll do next:\n1. Create a new GitHub repository (you can choose the name)\n2. Initialize it with our current clean code\n3. Push all 6 completed phases\n4. Set up for Vercel deployment\n5. Deploy to production\n\n**What would you like to name the new repository?**\n- `rankedceo-crm-v2`\n- `rankedceo-crm-production`\n- `rankedceo-crm-app`\n- Or suggest your own name\n\nOnce you confirm, I'll create it and get everything deployed!\n</ask>\n</function_calls>"}
